# Project 1 - MovieViewer

**MovieViewer** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

* Cells are deselected after returning from movie details
* Added icons onto UIbarcontroller and changed the background

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How they were able to implement the collection view, it's one of the optional
   features that I actually really wanted to get around to but didn't have the
   time to do this week.
2. Some cool, creative UI ideas that other people implemented.

## Notes

Working with the API's was a first for me, so trying to understand the
components was a bit of a challenge.
